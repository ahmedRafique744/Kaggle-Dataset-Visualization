    "I used the matplotlib.org documentation to learn more about other kinds of visual representation, and found that using bar charts could serve to be more efficient in organizaing my automobile.csv file since it had large amounts of data samples (close to 300). Thus, with the help of the bar() function, I was able to properly index my weight (kg) column data and my horsepower (fps) column data. The bar chart above shows the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The x-axis represents horsepower values, with more concentrated 'bars' indicating a high number of cars with the same horsepower as is the case between 50 and 100 fps.\n",
    "2) The y-axis represents weight in kg\n",
    "3) There is a close relationship between weight and horsepower of a car. As the weight increases, that is that we get bigger and bigger vehicles, a great horsepower is recorded. (weight and horsepower are proportional.\n",
    "4) The shape of the bars starts to flatten out, showing us that the weight increases at a decreasing rate with the increase in horsepower."
